      Kerala Fish Curry is a traditional South Indian dish known for its bold flavors and rich, tangy gravy. 
      Made with fresh fish simmered in a blend of spices, tamarind (or kokum), curry leaves, and often coconut or coconut milk, it captures the essence of Keralaâ€™s coastal cuisine.

      Typically served with steamed rice or kappa (tapioca), Kerala fish curry is a staple in Malayali homes and offers a perfect balance of heat, acidity, and deep coastal flavor.
